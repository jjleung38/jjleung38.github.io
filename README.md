**DTMProcessor** is a tool on ArcGIS designed to streamline the processing of Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) into a suite of essential topographic visualizations. The processors automate the conversion of DTMs (or similar files) into contour maps, hillshade maps, slope maps, and aspect maps. These outputs are helpful for terrain analysis and simplify complex geoprocessing tasks.
